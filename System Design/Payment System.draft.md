### Steps 0-1

The cardholder opens an account in the issuing bank and gets the debit/credit card. The merchant registers with ISO (Independent Sales Organization) or MSP (Member Service Provider) for in-store sales. ISO/MSP partners with payment processors to open merchant accounts. 

### Steps 2-5: Acquire

The payment gateway accepts the purchase transaction and collects payment information. It is then sent to a payment processor, which uses customer information to collect payments. The acquiring processor sends the transaction to the card network. It also owns and operates the merchant's account during settlement, which doesn't happen in real-time.

### Steps 6-8: Issue

The issuing processor talks to the card network on the issuing bank's behalf. It validates and operates the customer's account.
