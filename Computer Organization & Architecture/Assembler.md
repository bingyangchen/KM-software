An assembler program creates [object code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_code) by translating combinations of mnemonics and syntax for operations and addressing modes into their numerical equivalents.This representation typically includes an operation code ([opcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opcode)) as well as other control bits and data.

The assembler also calculates constant expressions and resolves symbolic names for memory locations and other entities. The use of **symbolic references** is a key feature of assemblers, saving tedious calculations and manual address updates after program modifications.

Some assemblers may also be able to perform some simple types of [instruction set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set)-specific [optimizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler_optimization). Others may even do simple rearrangement or insertion of instructions, such as some assemblers for [RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC) architectures that can help optimize a sensible [instruction scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_scheduling) to exploit the [CPU pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_pipeline) as efficiently as possible.
